Othello
=======

An Artificial Intelligence agent to play game of Othello with another agent

About the Project
-----------------

* Use Min-Max to implement search for best move. 
* Then Use Alpha Beta Pruning to make the search efficient

The agent is optimized to look at different depths in the Search tree depending upon the time left in the game.
It also uses custom heuristics working at different phases of the game to gain over teh opponent.
